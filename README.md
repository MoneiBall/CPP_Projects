#### Graphics Platform: OpenGL / Programming Lang: C++

* Creation and Texturing of rectangular plane Vertex Array Object (VAO), Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO), Fragment Shaders.
* Rotation (2D Transformations) of objects to ground plane, rotation by coordinate axes.
* Texturing and Shading via using mesh objects, appliance of uniform RGB coloring.
* Keyboard controlling direction, rotation and speed of the objects, support chaotic movement of multitudinous objects.
* Implementation and motion of lighting, feature to shade diffuse color.
